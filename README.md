Background: This summer I wanted to become a pro at programming, so I
naturally put a lot of strain on my hands from typing for hours
everyday. But I also wanted to get MUSCLES like any other guy my age, so
I was placing additional stress on my hands by going to the gym.
Eventually my hands gave out and I started getting wrist pain and my
fingers would slightly go numb, symptoms of RSI. I did some research and
learned that RSI was fairly common among programmers and in some cases
cripples careers, but was even more frustrated that there were no
dictation applications that allowed programmers program by voice, so I
built this in attempt to effectively cure RSI.

EDIT: a year later i'm finishing up an official consumer software verison of this for easier use for people without technical skills in hosting their own web server and packaging it all together etc.
